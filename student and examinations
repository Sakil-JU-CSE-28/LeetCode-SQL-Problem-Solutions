CROSS JOIN between Students and Subjects: This creates a cartesian product so that each student is paired with every subject, ensuring all possible combinations of students and subjects are included.

LEFT JOIN with Examinations: This ensures that even if a student has not attended any exams for a particular subject, the row will still appear with a NULL in Examinations.

COUNT(c.student_id): This will count the number of exams attended by the student. If no exams were attended, the count will return 0.
